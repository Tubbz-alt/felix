Thanks to François Dessenne for convincing me
to do a general rewrite of this class.

This is simple implementation of an unsigned 256 bit
integer type in C++. It's meant to be used like a standard
uintX_t, except with a larger bit size than those provided
by C/C++.

uint256_t requires uint128_t, which is included.

Be careful when initializing a uint128_t value. -1 does not
create the value 2<sup>256</sup> - 1. Rather, it uses 2<sup>64</sup> - 1, or
whatever the built-in max unsigned value is, NOT 2<sup>128</sup> - 1.
